			"Background": "Unity is a very active platform for indie developers, and I wanted to get comfortable working with it by making a simple, fun 2D game. Over the course of development I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of GameObjects/Components and practiced programming game logic, working my way up from simple collision detection, to scripts that play animations when the user presses a button, to data being preserved across scenes. While my code ended up being a little sloppy, it was my first time scripting in Unity and now that I'm comfortable working in that environment, the next game I make will be much better.",

	"surface-tension": {
		"name": "Surface Tension",
		"shortDescription": "A puzzle-platformer centered around manipulating surfaces",
		"description": {
			"main": "Surface Tension is a puzzle platform game that relies on manipulating the properties of surfaces to traverse obstacles. The player can make a surface bouncy to jump up high, or coat it in a slick sheet of ice to quickly slide across the surface. These surfaces are used to solve puzzles, like bouncing a block across a bouncy surface to get it up a ledge. Things get interesting when you use these surface types in tandem - often solutions require both speed and height. The gameplay consists of fast-paced maneuvers woven with restful periods of planning; levels challenge the player to think creatively, quickly, or even both at once.",
			"Background": "This game was developed for the course GMAP 260 (Overview of Computer Gaming) with a team of five, including myself. It was a great experience in applying the object-oriented principles and game programming patterns I've picked up since my previous projects. The codebase we ended up with was far more structured than any of our previous projects - I really pushed to keep our code organized (flexible, scalable, reusable, and functional), finding myself rewriting sections of code multiple times. I'm very proud of the final result; even after the course ended I've found myself adding functionality and improving the code.",

	"perceive-n-deceive": {
		"name": "Perceive n’ Deceive",
		"shortDescription": "A tabletop game of imperfect information",
		"description": {
			"main": "The objective of Perceive n’ Deceive is to collect a set of 3 cards of the same color. There are a total of 10 cards, and 9 of them have a color (Red, Blue, Green) and an action (Spy, Psychic,Thief). The Wildcard has no color and is considered to be a Spy, Psychic and Thief. \nA game is played on a board with a 3x3 grid of cards laid face down. The game is round-based, with players taking turns playing actions; who goes first is decided between players or by coin flip.",
			"Goal": "The main goal of a round is to identify and claim a Set from the array of cards. A Set consists of a card currently in your hand and two cards on the board that are all the same color. A round ends when a Set is called. When a round ends, the setup instructions are followed again to start a new round.\nThe player who claims a Set receives all tokens in the Pot.  The first player to reach 5 tokens wins.",
			"Playing a Turn": "Players should not reveal their card to their opponent (unless a Psychic is used). In the first phase of a player’s turn, they choose an action to use for this turn. After performing that action, the player returns their card to the board in the open spot and picks up a different card.",
			"Bluffing": "Additionally, correctly calling an opponent's bluff (i.e. they claim to use a different action than the one on their card) results in a win, while incorrectly calling an opponent’s bluff grants them the tokens in the Pot, plus one more.",
			"Background": "This game was made for the course GMAP 260 (Overview of Computer Gaming) with a team of four, including myself. Without any flashy digital effects, this was a great experience in fleshing out an interesting game design that engaged players in fun, balanced competition. It was a great exercise in developing deep, interesting game systems based on simple mechanics, a methodology we carried over to our next game in the class, Surface Tension."
